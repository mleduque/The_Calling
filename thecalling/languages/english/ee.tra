Tsu-O-Shi passed through the hands of the various heirs of the otherwise unremarkable Kasune family, until the powerful daimyo and well-known sword-lover Fushima Takagi saw it. Takagi became obsessed with the sword and made many frustrated attempts to acquire the blade. Finally, he hired a clan of ninja to steal the blade for him, covering its loss with the burning of the Kasune family compound. When the ninja presented the blade to their employer, it was used to cut them down, forever removing any link between Takagi and the sword's legitimate owners. Takagi hid the sword, often withdrawing to its hiding place to gaze upon its beauty and perfection. On the day Takagi died, his spirit refused to depart the earth and leave the sword behind, so he stayed with Tsu-O-Shi, becoming one with it. From that day forth, any who wield the mighty Tsu-O-Shi must beware of the spirit of Fushima Takagi, who drinks the life essence of those who touch the weapon, in order to remain on Toril with the object of his desire. As a result, this cursed blade has a chance to drain the wielder every time it is used.

@60036 = ~I shall try again: I am the Dreamheart. An entity that was born by hopes and powers of this old place and nurtured by all the men, women, animals, and creatures that stepped into this cave. I fed on their hopes. And as their minds and hearts and souls become brighter, infected with new ideas, as they painted on the walls, ate their food, danced, I was becoming more and more and more vivid.~
@60037 = ~This is a place of great power. When this world was far less advanced, they used to call this place the Grotto of Slumbergold. A place of spirits and earth.

@60051 = ~These walls are a home of golden dreams. Of memories. As I told you before, people came here for answers. To find peace. To mourn. Others came for different kinds of rituals. Those of fertility. They lay on the altars as their explored their pleasures, their flesh and pleasures. And I never minded that. Pleasure can be just as strong as fear and hope, when given a proper chance.~
@60052 = ~These creatures not only brought darkness but weakened centuries of memories. Uncountable moments that enriched the lives of others... and myself.~

@60075 = ~I have a proposal. Continue helping me. There is still something you could do for me. If you do, I will share something with you. A weapon left by another shaman. Something you could use in the upcoming battles.~
@60076 = ~And if I'd rather avoid such battles?~
@60077 = ~I can help you. I find this place interesting and worth protecting.~
@60078 = ~I can help you. It looks like there may be people that want me dead. I could use any resources I can get.~
@60079 = ~I'm not interested. Sorry, but I wasted enough time on those wolves. I need to go.~
@60080 = ~Haha! Well, I am sorry to say that, but I'm afraid that some battles and some of your enemies care little about what you'd prefer. And wielding a weapon doesn't mean you have to kill with it, does it?~
@60081 = ~Well, I suppose I can at least listen to what you need.~
@60082 = ~I don't think I have any more time to waste on you. I'm sorry, but I need to go.~
@60083 = ~I'm happy to hear it.~
@60084 = ~Those creatures you killed: their vile presence had an effect on this place, as I already told you. But the stain can still be erased, if a proper ritual is performed.~
@60085 = ~Here. Take this figurine and place it on where the followers of Kozah used to place their idol, on the altar, where the memory of Kozah took control over those poor diggers. It will link myself with the mundane incarnation of the grotto, the outer shell of the true Slumbergold. Once it is done, return to me, as this is not the only thing I will need you to do.~
@60086 = ~I'll do as you ask.~
@60087 = ~I don't have time for this.~
@60088 = ~I'll await your return, then.~
@60089 = ~A pity. But you know where to find me if you change your mind.~
@60090 = ~Take the heart figurine I gave you to where the followers of Kozah paced their idol. I'll wait for you here.~
@60091 = ~I can feel you placed the figurine on the altar. Thank you, you did well. Thanks to you, the corruption will be contained and won't spread. It's still there, but locked. Imagine a spiritual flask that won't let it grow or spread to other parts of the rocky flesh that builds the grotto.~
@60092 = ~Now, we will need a special herb to extract the corruption from the grotto: the Soulheart Herb. The problem is that this is a rare plant.~
@60093 = ~You would most likely think it grows in the forest, but no. It's usually found on the hillside, in rocky regions. So while I know it's not an easy task, if you want to help me, then you'll need to find this plant.~
@60094 = ~You're right, that's not very... specific. Where on Nine Hells am I suppose to find this herb?~
@60095 = ~I can't promise you that I'll find it, but I'll keep my eyes open.~
@60096 = ~How *very* specific. Humph! Well, it will be a miracle if I find it.~
@60097 = ~This place is my flesh and my whole world. I do not know where exactly you will find it. If I were you, however, I would look near the rocky regions. Perhaps go east, further from the salty breeze and see if you'll find some where the mountains rule the land.~
@60098 = ~I do believe that you may succeed. You look like a lucky <PRO_RACE>.~
@60099 = ~Find the Soulheart Herb, please. Look where mountains rise and reach for the skies above.~
@60100 = ~I can sense the sweet scent of the Soulheart Herb! You found it. Oh, this is quite exciting!~

Remember, though, as this means the corruption will be sucked out of these walls and you will need to face it. Please, do not die when that happens.~

@60107 = ~You helped me greatly, but... the fact that none of this is exactly a challenge for you makes me feel bored again.~
@60108 = ~Why the shift of tone? Speak!~
@60109 = ~I don't know what you're talking about. Help me understand what's going on.~
@60110 = ~I told you. I am fed by experience. By hope. By dreams. But also fears. Thrills. Pleasure. And many other sensations. When those diggers woke me, I felt hungry. Thus I tried to contact you. I sensed you back then, as you killed among the diggers. You felt... stronger. And I found you interesting.~
@60111 = ~These tasks of yours weren't only about the purification. That too, but—I was hungry for sensation. I was...~
@60112 = ~...bored. But you are like a fine refreshment. But now, after yet another victory of yours, I feel that there is a need for change. I want more than what I've seen. I am sorry, but we all need to eat something, and that's just how I satiate myself.~

@60119 = ~When I am bored, the dreams become dull and I start to seek more sensations. And I want more of that from you. I want more and more and more and...~
@60120 = ~...I just need it. I am sorry, that's nothing personal, but I am still so hungry.~
@60121 = ~This is enough. I am immortal. And you are strong. And you defeated those little things I created. I... respect you. I suppose I shouldn't torture someone that tried to help me. The little rush helped me and I will try to control the urge to feast.~
@60122 = ~I hope you will forgive me.~
@60123 = ~I'll try.~
@60124 = ~You just tried to kill me!~
@60125 = ~Gods, what are you? You're worse than Kozah!~
@60126 = ~Thank you. You are very understanding.~
@60127 = ~And for that I apologize. And I must admit you aren't easy to munch on.~
@60128 = ~Actually, I feasted on dreams of Kozah, so... But I'm not him. And I should have remembered that before I tried to kill you.~
@60129 = ~As you may have noticed, you cannot kill me, so let's just... forget about this. I will let you go. You tried to help me for quite a while now. I do appreciate it. And I promised you something. You will find it on the altar, in this incarnation of the Slumbergold.~
@60130 = ~I hope you will find peace and satiate your hunger, one day. I won't see it though, as I am done.~
@60131 = ~Your hunger must be truly great if you attacked me. But I suppose it's quite normal. You probably slept for many years and woke up... hungry.~
@60132 = ~That's true. I do feast of stories and promises and fantasies. When I first woke up, I sensed one of those diggers outside. He was reading something... a book. And it made me realize how empty I feel. How much I want to fill my body with something. Anything. Fear. Hope. Faith. Visions of rage, and celebration, and sex, and intrigues! Like in that book. A pity the man is dead and his things were taken by some thugs. Because I wonder how that book ended.~
@60133 = ~I know it may sound silly, but what If I brought you the book? Do you remember the title?~
@60134 = ~I care little about what you want and how you feel. I'm done. I'll take my reward and leave.~
@60135 = ~You'd do that for me? That would be something... new.~
@60136 = ~I think it was a story of the... Dead Three. I would love to read it. I never owned a book of my own.~
@60137 = ~I would be grateful if you brought me that book.~
@60138 = ~Of course. Let me tell you something, shaman. I believe there is a part of you that is made for great things. Keep that in mind as you will walk the path of your own story.~
@60139 = ~And I do apologize for all the hostility.~
@60140 = ~Believe me or not, but it's good to see you alive.~
@60141 = ~Right. Sorry, but I need to go.~
@60142 = ~I have the book you mentioned. Here. I'll leave it on this rock.~
@60143 = ~You... you truly brought me a book? You are full of surprises, shaman.~

@60145 = ~And let me tell you, that I think there is part of you, that... can surprise you just as you surprised me today. You are made for great things. Remember that.~
@60146 = ~Your usual dreams, for some reason, become something else. A vision of a cave filled with unusual paintings. They feel alive and somewhat enchanting. You're not sure how is it possible, but they echo in your mind, heart and soul, and then... they turn into a voice. One that lures you back to a place you've seen some time ago. The archaeological site. It's hard to say if it's all some kind of trick your mind is trying to play on you or something else. The dream becomes more and more vivid. The images become words. The words become a voice and it's quite different to anything you've ever heard before. And it repeats but a one phrase over and over again: "step into the ash and dream what once was dreamt... and lost."~

So, while those vile wolves are dead, and the cave has been purified from the corruption, we should also make sure no creatures like them will bother our beautiful sanctuary. That is why I would like to create a guardian for me.~
@60169 = ~Guardian?~

@60174 = ~Here. I have a special seed here. I want you to place it in front of the entrance, where you first met the diggers. There is a perfect spot for it, between the entrance, and the old entrance that isn't really... functional right now.~
@60175 = ~Then, water it. You will need the freshest water possible. There is a vessel somewhere... ah! Here! There is a place where you can get such water. There is a waterfall nearby. Place the a bowl under it, let it be filled, and then pour the water over the seed and let the wonders happen!~
@60176 = ~You did wonderful work with your other tasks, please, do not resign just yet. We are almost done.~

@70014 = ~This sword is known as Saiai no Hito. It was created by Ne Kurosuna, a former member of Saku Monastery. He was one of the original members of the monastery and he trained there for years. He was known for his keen mind and graceful techniques. He was also quite strong, probably one of the strongest monks among other members of the Saku Monastery while he was still there.

In the tenth year of his work, he started to develop romantic feelings for Shiroume Yakuchi, another monk from the same Monastery. While he could be called a master of discipline, body and strategy, he wasn't ready for this, as Ne lost his previous beloved to bandits that killed killed him. He never expected to develop such feelings again, and surely not to someone from the same monastery. That made him feel uneasy, torn between past love and the newly found one. He wasn't sure if he should ever tell Shiroume about his feelings. What if the man could never return these feelings? Would that change their friendship? And would that be a betrayal of his former loved one?

After few months, he decided that if he is to understand these feelings and decide what to do, he needed to leave the Monastery and ponder, pray for answers and enlightenment in solitude. As he liked to meditate through work, he started creating swords. Eventually, that lead him to the creation of this sword: Saiai no Hito. It was supposed to be a gift to Shiroume as Ne decided that peace can only be achieved by honesty. He hoped that... perhaps Master Yakuchi would understand, give them a chance or at least help them remain friends. Ne decided that would be a betrayal to his former love. He still respected his past. He still remembered it.

Saiai no Hito was supposed to be a symbol of love, companionship and enlightenment. However, Ne Kurosuna was killed on his way to the Monastery. The blade was then lost and it's hard to say how it... or rather its parts ended up on the Sword Coast, but it is there, where the blade was reforged and restored to its former glory.

The magic held by this sword was to help those that wield it, providing a great advantage in battle. If tales are to be believed it was also supposed to protect the heart of the monk from ever being crushed or broken.
